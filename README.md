# CarbonCoffee
It is a Java 17 experiment. The experiment is testing how big a JavaFX application can be. Basically, it's the whole Microsoft, Adobe, Corel, Blender etc suite in one Java application.

## It has a C++/Win32 version, too!
The SVN repository is [here](https://9a05-2601-647-6300-6380-14cb-aa1e-daf5-79a9.ngrok.io/svn/CarbonCoffee). Unfortunately my server software doesn't allow anonymous authentication, so **all you need to do to sign in is type lowercase a in both Username and Password fields.**  

Once I get a Mac, I'll make it native for that platform too (with the [C++ port of Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/)) and ditch Java because it's too slow.

## Why is this in the PizzaOS organization?
PizzaOS is having some [issues](https://github.com/pzos/PizzaOS/issues/1) that I don't know how to fix, so I'm working on this until someone steps up to work on that.
