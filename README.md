# CarbonCoffee
It is a Java 17 experiment. The experiment is testing how big a JavaFX application can be. Basically, it's the whole Microsoft, Adobe, Corel, Blender etc suite in one Java application.

# Edit
For now I'm getting tired of Java and working on [a C++ version](https://9f0e-2601-647-6300-6380-11e-9518-ef8-fca2.ngrok.io/svn/CarbonCoffee/) instead. It is open-source, it's just that my server software doesn't allow anonymous authentication. **Both Username and Password are lowercase a.**

## I need helpers!
Due to lack of a (physical) Mac machine, it is currently impossible for me to test this on Mac. Please, try it and open an issue if it fails. (No, MacOS virtual machines with Windows hosts don't support OpenGL ES 2.0)

## Why is this in the PizzaOS organization?
PizzaOS is having some [issues](https://github.com/pzos/PizzaOS/issues/1) that I don't know how to fix, so I'm working on this until someone steps up to work on that.
