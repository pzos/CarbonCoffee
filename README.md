# CarbonCoffee
It used to be a Java 17 experiment, but now it has moved to C++. The SVN repository is [here](https://9a05-2601-647-6300-6380-14cb-aa1e-daf5-79a9.ngrok.io/svn/CarbonCoffee). Unfortunately my server software doesn't allow anonymous authentication, so **all you need to do to sign in is type lowercase a in both Username and Password fields.**  

Once I get a Mac, I'll make it native for that platform too (with the [C++ port of Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/)).  

The GitHub repository is only for GitHub-specific things like Issues, Discussions, etc. and also for keeping backups of the SVN repository. Note that the backups are encrypted since they contain passwords.

## Why am I making a native C++ port?
Because I'm honestly tired of Java. No thanks, I just want to go back to good old-fashioned sources and headers. No more packages and Maven and Gradle stuff, please.

## Why is this in the PizzaOS organization?
PizzaOS is having some [issues](https://github.com/pzos/PizzaOS/issues/1) that I don't know how to fix, so I'm working on this until someone steps up to work on that.
